## Project Proposal:
USER STORY:
AS BOTH A BEER LOVER, AND A DOG LOVER
I WANT AN APP THAT ALLOWS ME TO SEE WHAT BREWERIES ARE DOG FRIENDLY
AND SEE THE WEATHER CONDITIONS SO I CAN DECIDE IF I WANT TO GO OUT WITH MY DOG OR NOT.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

WHEN I ENTER A ZIPCODE
THEN I SEE A LIST OF PET-FRIENDLY AREA BREWERIES
AND A CURRENT WEATHER REPORT SO THAT I CAN DECIDE IF OUTDOOR SEATING IS APPROPRIATE.
ON A MOBILE-FRIENDLY SITE

Hops & Hounds

Introduction:

Hops & Hounds is a mobile-optimized website with the goal of providing dog lovers with a list of nearby dog-friendly breweries so that our users can grab a brew at a place that allows their best friend(s) to come along too! This site is developed by students in the University of Arizona School of Continuing & Professional Educationâ€™s Full Stack Web Development Certificate Program, as a project that counts toward completion of said program. 

Summary: 

When a user lands on the app, they will be prompted to enter their zip code. Upon doing so, the user will see an interactive list of nearby, dog-friendly breweries that they can browse. Tapping or clicking on a brewery will allow the user to view more information about the brewery, including address, hours of operation, and more. In addition, the local weather information will be displayed underneath the brewery options, allowing users interested in walking to the brewery or in the possibility of outdoor seating to account for weather in their decision making process. 

Solution Outline:

This project will utilize both the Open Brewery DB and Openweather Api to provide information to the user. Both Api servers are either entirely free or have a free option. As this is merely a student project, the number of AJAX calls being made is not likely to be great enough to require a financial commitment to the API provider. 

Hops & Hounds will be coded in three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. jQuery will be used in support of Javascript, while Tailwind will be used in support of CSS. Results from Open Brewery DB will be displayed in a Carousel that users can swipe or click through, while the weather forecast will be displayed below. 

Timeline: 
A presentation of this project will occur on the morning of Monday, August 24, 2020, and all work on the project must be completed by then. The tentative timeline is as follows: 

By end of day 8/18: Planning will have been completed, coding will have begun
By end of day 8/21: Basic functionality will be present, additional objectives will have begun. 
By end of day 8/23: A completed app will be live and hosted on Github

Additional Objectives

While our goal is to have a base level of functionality by project completion, the project is well suited to additional challenges and content. A brief list of additional possibilities follows below.
Functionality to allow mobile users to dial a brewery directly from the app

Functionality to load a brewery address into Google Maps or another mapping service (for directions)

Functionality to view a beer list or menu for a specified brewery

Functionality to customize the weather display to show the forecast at a specific time (allowing the user to plan in advance)

Conclusion

Thank you for your interest in Hops & Hounds, our team is excited to begin this project and looks forward to both the development process, and a successful presentation as we undertake our first dive into collaborative development.
