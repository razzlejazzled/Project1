USER STORY:
AS BOTH A BEER LOVER, AND A DOG LOVER
I WANT AN APP THAT ALLOWS ME TO SEE WHAT BREWERIES ARE DOG FRIENDLY
AND SEE THE WEATHER CONDITIONS SO I CAN DECIDE IF I WANT TO GO OUT WITH MY DOG OR NOT.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

WHEN I ENTER A ZIPCODE
THEN I SEE A LIST OF PET-FRIENDLY AREA BREWERIES
AND A CURRENT WEATHER REPORT SO THAT I CAN DECIDE IF OUTDOOR SEATING IS APPROPRIATE.
ON A MOBILE-FRIENDLY SITE
